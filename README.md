# Team 10 - Final Project

## Columbia Density Data Exploration
We are going to explore the historical data (from now until 6/27/2014) from Application Development Initiative's Density project: http://density.adicu.com/
Some topics we hope to explore are:
- Optimal time to eat at school dining hall
    - potentially create real time differential lunch time reccomendation system, i.e. it's crowded now but in 10 minutes everyone has to rush to class etc.
        - maybe trend filtering + importance sampling
- Similar exploration within the libraries such as Butler or Northwest Corner
- Most 'studious' times of the semester based on aggregate library usage
- Most 'hungry' times of the semester based on aggregate dining hall usage
- correlation?
