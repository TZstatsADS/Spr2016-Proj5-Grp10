## Columbia Density Data Exploration
- Optimal time to eat at school dining hall
    potentially create real time differential lunch time reccomendation system, i.e. it's crowded now but in 10 minutes everyone has to rush to class etc.
- Similar exploration within the libraries such as Butler or Northwest Corner
- Most 'studious' times of the semester based on aggregate library usage
- Most 'hungry' times of the semester based on aggregate dining hall usage
- correlation?
